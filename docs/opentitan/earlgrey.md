## Running the virtual machine

### Arbitrary application

````sh
qemu-system-riscv32 -M ot-earlgrey,no_epmp_cfg=true -display none -serial mon:stdio \
  -readconfig docs/config/opentitan/earlgrey.cfg \
  -kernel hello.elf
````

See the section "Useful execution options" for documentation about the `no_epmp_cfg` option.

### Boot sequence ROM, ROM_EXT, BLO

````sh
qemu-system-riscv32 -M ot-earlgrey -display none -serial mon:stdio \
  -readconfig docs/config/opentitan/earlgrey.cfg \
  -object ot-rom_img,id=rom,file=rom_with_fake_keys_fpga_cw310.elf \
  -drive if=pflash,file=otp-rma.raw,format=raw \
  -drive if=mtd,bus=2,file=flash.raw,format=raw
````

where `otp-rma.raw` contains the RMA OTP image and `flash.raw` contains the signed binary file of the
ROM_EXT and the BL0. See [`otptool.py`](otptool.md) and [`flashgen.py`](flashgen.md) tools to
generate the `.raw` image files.

See [`rom_ctrl.md`](rom_ctrl.md) for information on ROM option.

## Tools

See [`tools.md`](tools.md)

## Useful execution options

### vCPU

* `-icount 6` reduces the execution speed of the vCPU (Ibex core) to 1GHz >> 6, _i.e._ ~15MHz,
  which should roughly match the expected speed of the Ibex core running on the CW310 FPGA, which
  is set to 10 MHz. This option is very useful/mandatory to run many OpenTitan tests that rely on
  time or CPU cycle to validate features. Using `-icount` option slows down execution speed though,
  so it is not recommended to use it when the main goal is to develop SW to run on the virtual
  machine.

* `no_epmp_cfg=true` can be appended to the machine option switch, _i.e._
  `-M ot-earlgrey,no_epmp_cfg=true` to disable the initial ePMP configuration, which can be very
  useful to execute arbitrary code on the Ibex core without requiring an OT ROM image to boot up.

* `ignore_elf_entry=true` can be appended to the machine option switch, _i.e._
  `-M ot-earlgrey,ignore_elf_entry=true` to prevent the ELF entry point of a loaded application to
  update the vCPU reset vector at startup. When this option is used, with `-kernel` option for
  example, the application is loaded in memory but the default machine reset vector is used.

* `verilator=true` can be appended to the machine option switch, to select Verilator lowered clocks:
  _i.e._ `-M ot-earlgrey,verilator=true` to select Verilator reduced clock rates.

* `-cpu lowrisc-ibex,x-zbr=false` can be used to force disable the Zbr experimental-and-deprecated
  RISC-V bitmap extension for CRC32 extension.

### AES

* `-global ot-aes.fast-mode=false` can be used to better emulate AES HW IP, as some OT tests expect
  the Ibex core to execute while the HW is performing AES rounds. Without this option, the virtual
  HW may only give back execution to the vCPU once the AES operation is complete, which make those
  OT tests to fail. Disabling fast mode better emulates the HW to the expense of higher AES latency
  and throughput.

### Display

 * `-display none` can be used to prevent QEMU to open a semi-graphical windows as the default
   console, and use the current shell instead.

### Embedded Flash

* `-drive if=mtd,id=eflash,bus=2,file=<filename>,format=raw` should be used to specify a path to a
  QEMU RAW image file used as the OpenTitan internal flash controller image. This _RAW_ file should
  have been generated with the [`flashgen.py`](flashgen.md) tool.

  Note: MTD bus 2 is assigned to the internal controller with the embedded flash storage. See also
  the SPI Host section.

### Ibex Wrapper

The `FPGA_INFO` register of the Ibex Wrapper device is used to report that the HW platform is a QEMU
virtual machine. It contains three ASCII chars `QMU` followed with a configurable _version_ field in
the MSB, whose meaning is not defined. It can be any 8-byte value, and defaults to 0x0. To configure
this version field, use the `qemu_version` property of the Ibex Wrapper device.

The `DV_SIM_STATUS` register (address 0 of the `DV_SIM_WINDOW`) can be used to exit QEMU with a
passing or failing status code. The lower half of the word is written either `900d` (good) or `baad`
(bad). If an error code is written to the upper half of the word, QEMU will exit with that status
code for failures. The `-global ot-ibex_wrapper.dv-sim-status-exit=[on|off]` can be used to control
whether QEMU shuts down when this register is written.

There are two modes to handle address remapping, with different limitations:

- default mode: use an MMU-like implementation (via ot_vmapper) to remap addresses. This mode
  enables to remap instruction accesses and data accesses independently, as the real HW. However,
  due to QEMU limitations, addresses and mapped region sizes should be aligned and multiple of 4096
  bytes, i.e. a standard MMU page size. This is the recommended mode.

- legacy mode: This mode has no address nor size limitations, however it cannot distinguish
  instruction accesses from data accesses, which means that both kind of accesses must be defined
  for each active remapping slot for the remapping to be enabled. Moreover it relies on MemoryRegion
  aliasing and may not be as robust as the default mode. It is recommended to use the default mode
  whenever possible. To enable this legacy mode, set the `alias-mode` property to true:
  `-global ot-ibex_wrapper.alias-mode=true`

### Keymgr

See documentation in [`keymgr.md`](./keymgr.md).

### OTBN

* `-global ot-otbn.logfile=<filename>` output OTBN execution message to the specified logfile. When
  _logasm_ option (see below) is not enabled, only execution termination and error messages are
  logged. `stderr` can be used to log the messages to the standard error stream instead of a file.

* `-global ot-otbn.logasm=<true|false>` dumps executed instructions on OTBN core into the _logfile_
  filename. Beware that this further slows down execution speed, which could likely result in the
  guest application on the Ibex core to time out.

### OTP

* `-drive if=pflash,file=otp.raw,format=raw` should be used to specify a path to a QEMU RAW image
  file used as the OpenTitan OTP image. This _RAW_ file should have been generated with the
  [`otptool.py`](otptool.md) tool.

### SPI Host

* `-drive if=mtd,bus=0,file=<filename>,format=raw` should be used to specify a path to a QEMU RAW
  image file used as the SPI data flash backend file. This _RAW_ file should have been created with
  the qemu-img tool. There is no dedicated tool to populate this image file for now.

  ````sh
  qemu-img create -f raw spi.raw 16M
  ````

  MTD bus 0 is assigned to the SPI0 Host controller and MTD bus 1 is assigned to the SPI1 Host
  controller. See also Embedded Flash controller section.

* `-global ot-earlgrey-board.spiflash<bus>=<flash_type>` should be used to instanciate a SPI
  dataflash device of the specified type to the first device (/CS0) of the specified bus.
  Any SPI dataflash device supported by QEMU can be used. To list the supported devices, use
  `grep -F 'INFO("' hw/block/m25p80.c | cut -d'"' -f2`

* `-global ot-spi_host.start-delay=<time>` may be used to change the default SPI Host FSM start
  delay. This delay is used to yield back the control to the vCPU before kicking of the execution
  of a new SPI Host command, so that the guest code gets a chance to check the statuses of the SPI
  Host right after pushing the command. Without this delay, the SPI Host state may change quickly
  and report statuses that might be different than the real HW, _e.g._ a command may already be
  completed when the guest code reads back the SPI Host status. Time should be specified in ns,
  and defaults to 20000 (20 µs).

* -`global ot-spi_host.completion-delay=<time>` may be forced to discard the experimental SPI Host
  clock pacing, which helps to achieve the requested bandwidth on the SPI Host bus, which is always
  caped with the performances of the QEMU host. Forcing a small value here can help achieving the
  best SPI Host transfer performances, but decreases accuracy of the SPI Host clock settings. Time
  should be specified in ns, and defaults to 0 that indicates automatic SPI bus clock management.

### UART

See documentation in [`uart.md`](./uart.md).

### I2C

* `-device <name>,bus=<bus>,address=<address>` can be used to attach devices at a specific address
  to one of the three I2C buses. The buses are named `ot-i2c0`, `ot-i2c1`, and `ot-i2c2`.

### USBDEV

* `-chardev pty,id=usbdev-cmd` can be used to connect to the usbdev driver (commands).
* `-chardev pty,id=usbdev-host` can be used to connect to the usbdev driver (host).

See the [USBDEV documentation](usbdev.md) for more details.

## Useful debugging options

### Device log traces

Most OpenTitan virtual devices can emit log traces. To select which traces should be logged, a plain
text file can be used along with QEMU `-trace` option.

To populate this file, the easiest way is to dump all available traces and filter them with a
pattern, for example to get all OpenTitan trace messages:

````sh
qemu-system-riscv32 -trace help | grep -E '^ot_' > ot_trace.log
qemu-system-riscv32 -trace events=ot_trace.log -D qemu.log ...
````

* It is *highly* recommended to use the `-D` option switch when any `-trace` or `-d` (see below) is
selected, to avoid saturating the standard output stream with traces and redirect them into the
specified log file.

### QEMU log traces

QEMU provides another way of logging execution of the virtual machine using the `-d` option. Those
log messages are not tied to a specific device but rather to QEMU features. `-d help` can be used
to enumerate these log features, however the most useful ones are enumerated here:

   * `unimp` reports log messages for unimplemented features, _e.g._ when the vCPU attempts to
     read from or write into a memory mapped device that has not been implemented.
   * `guest_errors` reports log messages of invalid guest software requests, _e.g._ attempts to
     perform an invalid configuration.
   * `int` reports all interruptions *and* exceptions handled by the vCPU. It may be quite verbose
     but also very useful to track down an invalid memory or I/O access for example. This is the
     first option to use if the virtual machine seems to stall on start up.
   * `in_asm` reports the decoded vCPU instructions that are translated by the QEMU TCG, _i.e._ here
     the RISC-V instructions. Note that transcoded instructions are cached and handled by blocks,
     so the flow of transcoded instruction do not exactly reflect the stream of the executed guest
     instruction, e.g. may only appear once in a loop. Use the next log option, `exec`, to get
     more detailed but also much more verbose log traces.
   * `exec` reports the vCPU execution stream.

Those options should be combined with a comma separator, _e.g._ `-d unimp,guest_errors,int`

`in_asm` option may be able to report the name of the guest executed function, as long as the guest
application symbols have been loaded. This is the case when the `-kernel` option is used to load
an ELF non-stripped file. Unfortunately, this feature is not available for guest applications that
are loaded from a raw binary file (`.bin`, `.signed.bin`, ...). However the
[`flashgen.py`](flashgen.md) script implements a workaround for this feature, please refer to this
script for more details.

Finally, a Rust demangler has been added to QEMU, which enables the QEMU integrated dissambler to
emit the demangled names of the Rust symbols for Rust-written guest applications rather than their
mangled versions as stored in the ELF file.
